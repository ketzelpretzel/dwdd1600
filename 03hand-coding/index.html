        <h1>Declaration of Independence</h1>
        <h2>What It Says</h2>
        <p> The Declaration of Independence was designed for multiple audiences: the King, the colonists, and the world.
            It was also designed to multitask. Its goals were to rally the troops, win foreign allies, and to announce
            the creation of a new country. The introductory sentence states the Declaration's main purpose, to explain
            the colonists' right to revolution. In other words, “to declare the causes which impel them to the
            separation.” Congress had to prove the legitimacy of its cause. It had just defied the most powerful nation
            on Earth. <em><strong>It needed to motivate foreign allies to join the fight.</strong></em></p>
        <h4>Preamble</h4>
        <p>These are the lines contemporary Americans know best: <em>“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all
                men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that
                among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of happiness.”</em> These stirring words were designed to
            convince Americans to put their lives on the line for the cause. Separation from the mother country
            threatened their sense of security, economic stability, and identity. <strong> The preamble sought to
                inspire and unite them through the vision of a better life.</strong></p>
        <h4>List of Grievances</h4>
        <p>The list of 27 complaints against King George III constitute the proof of the right to rebellion. Congress
            cast “the causes which impel them to separation” in universal terms for an international audience. Join our
            fight, reads the subtext, and you join humankind’s fight against tyranny.</p>
        <h4>Resolution of Independence</h4>
        <p>The most important and dramatic statement comes near the end: “That these United Colonies are, and of Right
            ought to be Free and Independent States.” It declares a complete break with Britain and its King and claims
            the powers of an independent country.</p>

        <h2>Why Were They Upset?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>The King refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.</li>
            <li>The King dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on
                the rights of the people.</li>
            <li>The King obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing
                Judiciary powers.</li>
            <li>The King kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.</li>
