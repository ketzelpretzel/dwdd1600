                <strong>Rose Quartz</strong>
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Rose Quartz, an Earth-grown gem, was the founder of The Crystal Gems and leader of the Rebellion in
                    the Gem War over Earth.
                </p>
            </dd>
            <dd>
                <p>Rose recently gave up her physical form to start a family with human Greg Universe, giving life and
                    her gem to her son Steven.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt>
                <strong>Pearl</strong>
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Pearl is elegant, intelligent, and highly skilled in combat. Her gem weapon is a spear, but she
                    is also an expert swordswoman.</p>
            </dd>
            <dd>
                <p>When it comes to fusion and combat, Pearl's form references masterful ballet.</p>
            </dd>
            <dd>
                <p>Pearl fought in the Rebellion and now dedicates her life to protecting Earth in the name of Rose
                    Quartz, as well as rearing Rose's son Steven.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt>
                <strong>Garnet</strong>
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Garnet is the strong, stoic, and wise. After Rose Quartz chose to give life to Steven, Garnet took
                    the unofficial helm of leader of The Crystal Gems. Her weapons are hammer gauntlets, a
                    staple of Ruby gems.</p>
            </dd>
            <dd>
                <p>When it comes to fusion and combat, Garnet's dance and form references waacking (a street dance style
                    from the 1970's).</p>
            </dd>
            <dd>
                <p>Garnet is a permanent fusion of Ruby and Sapphire, symbolizing their love and unity. Because of this,
                    Garnet posesses a Sapphire's future vision abilities and the combat skills of a Ruby.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt>
                <strong>Amethyst</strong>
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Amethyst is fun-loving, wild, and full of energy. Having emerged from Earth a couple thousand years
                    <em>after</em> the Gem War, Amethyst never saw combat or life outside of Earth. Because of this, she
                    has an affinity for Earth and the human experience. Despite her apathetic nature, she deeply cares
                    for
                    Steven and the other Crystal Gems. Her gem weapon is a whip.
                </p>
            </dd>
            <dd>
                <p>When it comes to fusion, Amethyst's dance and form references dance hall/club dancing. In combat, her
                    style is wild and often considered wreckless.</p>
            </dd>
            <dd>
                <p>It should also be noted that Amethyst is considered defective because of her prolonged gestation in
                    the Prime Kindergarten. As a result, she is physically smaller than other Amethyst gems.</p>
            </dd>

            <dt>
                <strong>Steven Universe</strong>
            </dt>
            <dd>
                <p>Steven is the young teen son of gem Rose Quartz and human Greg Universe. He is kind natured and
                    forgiving, often chosing communication and compassion over violence. Despite only being half human
                    and half gem, Steven's abilities are far beyond the norm of either. His gem weapon is Rose Quartz's
                    shield.</p>
            </dd>
            <dd>
                <p>Steven has an affinity for music, cooking, videogames, and reading. Steven will take any and every
                    opportunity to make a friend. </p>
